#Project-1

This directory contains:
*The code that implements a Binary Search Tree
*A program designed for ACME Solutions

I didn't use the demo filesfor this project I
prefered making my own code from the ground 
because I didn't understand completly the code
that the professor gave us.

I received help with this project,
a friend from the CS major help me with the
understanding of how a program write and read 
a file.
